This is notes from Scott's Fall 2019 10-week course on Mixed Effect Models.

General approach:
- Most data analysis depends on a model of data
-- Structure: what variables/relations
-- Parameters: what are the values of those relationships

Simulating data
- Force you to think about data generating model

MEM (Mixed effect models)
- really good with unbalanced data 


```{r}
library(tidyverse)

#use Cmd+Alt+I to add new chunks
```

```{r}

```
